# logo-generator-
The goal of this project was to create an SVG Logo company that accepts user input using Inquirer and outputs a logo.svg file using FS.
Behind the scenes, the programming style used in this project was Object-Oriented Programming meaning that the main index file instead calls to objects for information or methods to go through the process.
In addition, we used Jest to develop some tests to make sure nthat the program was created exactly as expected.
